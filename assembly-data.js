The Democratic Summit ended in chaos and financial panic yesterday due to the "completely disgraceful" conduct of Lanky Kong. During a photo op, Lanky inflated himself and flew around the room, terrifying a visiting president and causing a severe diplomatic fallout for the DK Crew.

The incident sent the Mushroom Kingdom's currency into a two-hour freefall, with the Kremling Koin now trading at 4.5 times the value of the DK Crew's "Banana Bunch." The Kong family is now in turmoil, with Diddy Kong motioning for Lanky's expulsion.`,

In a tragic and shocking development, Princess Peach, beloved ruler of the Mushroom Kingdom, has been confirmed dead. Reports from the fractured kingdom indicate she was killed during a brief but devastating civil conflict, the culmination of years of escalating tensions.

While precise circumstances remain unclear, many within the Protectorate blame Bowser, whose relentless campaigns are seen as having created the instability that led to the war. The Mushroom Kingdom is now in disarray, with a fractured Regency Council struggling to maintain order.`,

Sources claim the diminutive toad, Dan, played a pivotal role, disarming the sorceress of her powerful staff at a critical moment. The recapturing of the _Vigilance_ is a significant blow to X.O.'s mysterious agenda.`,
