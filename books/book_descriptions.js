    "Mushroom Kingdom History, Vol. III": {
        overview: "A weighty tome that chronicles the kingdom’s turbulent evolution during the Civil War and its ties to the broader Midlands conflicts, serving as a scholarly yet battle-scarred record.",
        binding: "Measuring 10 inches by 7 inches, the book is bound in a sturdy maroon leather cover, its surface embossed with a detailed relief of the Mushroom Kingdom’s iconic toadstool landscape—curved caps and dotted spots—framed by a border of interlocking gears, symbolizing the industrial influences of the Iron Legion. The edges of the cover are scuffed and darkened with soot stains, evidence of its use in field tents or besieged libraries, while the spine bears the title in embossed gold lettering, 'HISTORY OF THE MUSHROOM KINGDOM VOL. 3,' with volume number subtly underlined in red ink.",
        cover_art: "The cover features a central illustration: a panoramic view of Toad Town under siege, its mushroom houses ablaze, with Peach’s Castle looming in the background, its pink spires cracked and overtaken by green beanstalks—a nod to Fawful’s occupation. Silhouettes of key factions—Koopa Troopas with raised shells, Peach Loyalists with pink banners, and a distant werewolf howl from the Moonfang Pack—frame the scene, rendered in faded sepia tones to evoke historical weight. A small crest at the bottom, a golden crown atop a mushroom, ties it to the Regal Empire’s expanding influence.",
        interior_notes: "Inside, the pages are thick, cream-colored parchment, edged with a faint green tint from mushroom ink, filled with dense text in a crisp, formal script, interspersed with hand-drawn maps, battle diagrams, and annotated sketches. A pressed silverwort leaf marks a page on the Moonfang Pack’s territorial clashes, its silver hue preserved, while a charred fragment of a Loyalist banner is taped to a section on the castle siege.",
