        `...from the preface by Artificer Prime Kael.\n\nThe primitive mage treats magic as a fleeting, unpredictable force. They supplicate, they bargain, they perform their crude rituals. The magitek engineer, however, sees magic for what it is: a fundamental energy of the universe, no different from lightning or heat. It can be captured, stored, and discharged. It can be made to serve. This volume details the principles of the Arcane Capacitor, the heart of all modern magitek.`,
        `Chapter 2: The Mycelian Capacitor\n\nThe Ironshroom (Ferrum myces) of the Midlands presents a fascinating case study. Its metallic properties allow it to passively absorb and store ambient magical energy. While inefficient, it demonstrates the core principle: a material lattice can be attuned to hold arcane charge. Early experiments in smelting the fungus with iron led to the creation of Mycelian Steel, which retains a minor charge, giving it its superior strength.`,
        `Chapter 5: Crystal Matrix Attunement\n\nModern capacitors rely on precisely-cut crystals, often quartz or amethyst, attuned to a specific frequency of magical energy. The crystal matrix acts as a 'magical battery'. The challenge is not in storing the energy, but in preventing 'arcane bleed' - the slow, steady leakage of power back into the ambient environment. The use of silver filaments has proven to be an effective, if costly, insulator.`,
        `Chapter 8: The 'Vigilance' Power Core (Theoretical)\n\nThe power core of the IMS Vigilance represents the pinnacle of capacitor technology. It is not a single crystal, but a harmonized network of a dozen master-crystals, each handling a different aspect of the ship's power needs. The true innovation, however, is the central regulation unit, which can shunt power between capacitors instantaneously. The theoretical power output is sufficient to level a small city. The consequences of a catastrophic failure are... best left uncalculated.`
