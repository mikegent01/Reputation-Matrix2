        content: `**MUTINY ON THE VIGILANCE!** An internal power struggle among the 150 newly freed toads erupted into violence aboard the rogue airship. The conflict took a dark turn when the toad hero, Dan, reportedly suffered a magical breakdown while attempting to seize X.O.'s powerful staff, unleashing a fireball that killed 13 of his kin. Witnesses claim Green T of the Tea Leaf Syndicate intervened, losing an arm in the process, before the staff was secured by another toad, Toad Lee. A fragile 'vow' has since been sworn, but the ship is a powder keg.`,
