Under observation by the Arbiters of Intent.", presiding_judge: "Arbitrix Mira (Arbiter of Intent Faction)", notes: "The defendant's actions often lead to a net positive result, creating a legal paradox.

His entire kingdom is declared a rogue state operating outside cosmic law.", presiding_judge: "The Full Tribunal", notes: "Enforcement of this verdict is currently... impractical.
