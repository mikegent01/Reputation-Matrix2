The Arbiters of Intent found his actions, while chaotic, ultimately served a greater cosmic balance. The Truthbearers have formally lodged an appeal.", presiding_judge: "Arbitrix Mira (Arbiter of Intent Faction)", notes: "A controversial verdict that has deepened the schism between the two major judicial factions." },
        { case: "Case #772: The Matter of the Fallen Paladin", charge: "Betrayal of Oath, Aiding and Abetting Known Criminals.", defendant: "Markop Judi", verdict: "Judgment deferred. Under observation by the Arbiters of Intent.", presiding_judge: "Arbitrix Mira (Arbiter of Intent Faction)", notes: "The defendant's actions often lead to a net positive result, creating a legal paradox. The Arbiters continue to debate the nature of his intent versus the letter of the law." },
        { case: "Case #773: The Illegitimate State", charge: "Waging an Unlawful War of Aggression.", defendant: "King Bowser", verdict: "Guilty. His entire kingdom is declared a rogue state operating outside cosmic law.", presiding_judge: "The Full Tribunal", notes: "Enforcement of this verdict is currently... impractical. A case file is being built for future action." }
