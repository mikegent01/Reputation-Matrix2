// This file contains detailed, narrative assessments of how each faction views the player characters.

export const FACTION_ASSESSMENTS = {
    regal_empire: {
        archie: `The Empire views Archie as a high-priority anarchist and a significant threat. His central role in the 'Vigilance' hijacking and flagrant disregard for Imperial law mark him as a public enemy. While some internal factions see his chaos as useful data, the overwhelming official stance is one of extreme hostility.`,
        markop: `Markop is seen as a tragic failure and an embarrassment. As a former paladin, his association with known criminals reflects poorly on the institutions he once served. He is considered a person of interest, a symbol of the chaos threatening the Imperial peace.`,
        humpik: `As Bowser's lieutenant, Humpik is considered part of a hostile foreign military. His presence on the 'Vigilance' is a direct breach of Imperial security, and he is tracked as a key operative of an enemy warlord.`,
        bowser: `Bowser is a long-standing threat to Imperial interests and a rival monarch. His capture and subsequent alliance with the party are viewed with extreme suspicion. He has high notoriety as a significant and hostile foreign power.`,
    },
    iron_legion: {
        archie: `The Legion's Old Guard despises Archie's lack of discipline. However, the younger War-Forged faction grudgingly respects his effectiveness and destructive power, seeing him as a potential, if messy, deniable asset. His name is known in Legion barracks, often as a cautionary tale.`,
        markop: `A fallen paladin is the epitome of broken discipline to the Legion. They view Markop with contempt, seeing his current path as a betrayal of the martial orders they respect. He is a known associate of their enemies.`,
        humpik: `Humpik is recognized as a loyal and capable soldier, but one who serves a rival warlord. The Legion respects his strength and the power he commands but sees him as an enemy combatant by default.`,
        bowser: `The Iron Legion views Bowser as a rival military commander. They respect his strength and the power he commands but see him as an obstacle to Imperial expansion. He is a well-documented and recognized military threat.`,
    },
    freelancer_underworld: {
        archie: `Archie is a chaotic force in the underworld. The established Syndicates see him as a liability who brings unwanted official attention. Conversely, independent operators and information brokers appreciate the lucrative chaos he creates, making him a notorious but divisive figure.`,
        markop: `Markop's moral code makes him an untrustworthy and unpredictable element in the criminal underworld. Most freelancers avoid him, assuming he's either a snitch or a mark. His notoriety is low, as he's not considered a serious player.`,
        humpik: `Known only as Bowser's muscle, Humpik has little personal standing here. He is seen merely as an extension of his boss's will, with no independent reputation in the network.`,
        bowser: `Bowser is too 'loud' for the subtle games of the Freelancer Underworld. He is viewed as a client or a target, not a colleague. His methods are too overt, and his goals (conquest) don't align with their pursuit of profit.`,
    },
    toad_gang: {
        archie: `Archie is a controversial figure. The Mushroom Skulls faction celebrates him for his role in Big T's defeat, seeing him as an unwitting kingmaker. However, Big T's loyalists and the profit-focused Extortionists see him as a chaotic meddler who cost them money and power.`,
        markop: `As an enemy of Big T and a friend to the heroic toad Dan, Markop is viewed with uniform hostility by the entire gang. He represents order and justice, concepts they vehemently oppose.`,
        humpik: `Humpik is known for personally clashing with Big T and his forces. He has a high degree of notoriety as a direct and powerful enemy of the gang, responsible for many of their recent losses.`,
        bowser: `The Toad Gang sees Bowser as just another tyrant, no different from the Empire. They have no respect for his monarchical ambitions and view him as a potential competitor in the business of oppression.`,
    },
    toad_cult: {
        archie: `The cult is divided on Archie. The mainstream Chosen see his chaos as a blight upon the natural world. While some younger warriors respect his power, the leadership views him as an unstable and destructive force, a walking natural disaster.`,
        markop: `Markop's orderly nature and his attempts to guide others toward a 'good' path make him an antagonist to the cult's chaotic beliefs. He is seen as an agent of the status quo they wish to unravel.`,
        humpik: `Humpik is largely ignored by the cult. His straightforward nature and loyalty offer nothing of interest to their esoteric and chaotic prophecies. He is simply not part of their divine equation.`,
        bowser: `The cultists find Bowser's straightforward ambition for conquest to be utterly boring. He seeks to impose a new order, while they seek to dissolve all order. He is irrelevant to their grand, mad design.`,
    },
    onyx_hand: {
        archie: `The vampire elders see Archie as a magnificent pawn. His acquittal in their tribunal was a masterstroke that sowed chaos within the rival Mages' Guild. He is highly notorious and viewed as a valuable, if unpredictable, tool to be observed from a safe distance.`,
        markop: `The Onyx Hand holds a grudging respect for paladins as worthy adversaries. Markop's fall from grace makes him an object of curiosity and contempt. They watch to see if his light can be fully extinguished, making him a person of interest.`,
        humpik: `The vampires are unimpressed by brute strength alone. Humpik is noted as Bowser's bodyguard but is otherwise considered an uninteresting, purely physical threat with no political value.`,
        bowser: `As a fellow long-lived monarch, the elders see Bowser as a peer, albeit a crude and unsubtle one. They respect his ambition but view his methods as amateurish. His war with the Moonfang Pack's allies, however, makes him a situational asset.`,
    },
    mages_guild: {
        archie: `Archie is reviled by the Mages' Guild. He is the prime suspect in a mage-killing, practices unsanctioned magic, and embodies the uncontrolled chaos they fear. His notoriety is extremely high, and the Conservator faction has marked him as a priority threat to be neutralized.`,
        markop: `Due to his close association with Archie, Markop is considered an accomplice to magical crimes. The Guild sees his failure to restrain his companion as a sign of weakness or, worse, silent approval.`,
        humpik: `The Guild has no specific opinion of Humpik, other than noting he is allied with a group containing multiple magical threats and anomalies. He is considered collateral damage in any future confrontation.`,
        bowser: `The Guild views Bowser's court Magikoopas as hedge wizards practicing a crude, inferior form of magic. They see Bowser himself as a warlord who uses magic as a blunt instrument, deserving of little respect.`,
    },
    rakasha_clans: {
        archie: `The shamans of the Spirit-Walkers see Archie's chaotic energy as a blight upon the natural world. While some younger warriors respect his power, the leadership views him as an unstable and destructive force, a walking natural disaster.`,
        markop: `Markop is held in high esteem. His quest for redemption is considered honorable, and his decision to place Dan the Toad under their tutelage was a masterstroke of diplomacy. The Spirit-Walkers see him as a true friend and ally.`,
        humpik: `The Rakasha respect Humpik's strength and loyalty to his 'chieftain' (Bowser), as it mirrors their own clan values. The Beast-Riders in particular see him as a strong warrior worthy of respect.`,
        bowser: `The clans are wary of Bowser. They see him as an invader and a king who seeks to tame the wilderness, not live in harmony with it. His goals are fundamentally opposed to their way of life.`,
    },
    cosmic_jesters: {
        archie: `Archie is a prophet. A divine instrument. His every destructive, chaotic, and illogical act is seen as a prayer to the Cosmic Jester. He is idolized by the cult, and his high notoriety is a mark of supreme holiness in their eyes. They follow his exploits with religious fervor.`,
        markop: `The cult finds Markop dreadfully boring. He tries to create order from chaos, which they see as an insult to their god. He is the straight man in the universe's greatest joke, and they barely notice him.`,
        humpik: `Humpik is a simple, predictable variable. The Jesters find his unwavering loyalty amusing in its simplicity, like a child's toy that only does one thing. He is not important to them.`,
        bowser: `Bowser's predictable schemes of conquest are the antithesis of the Jester's delightful madness. He is seen as a hack comedian telling the same joke over and over. They have no interest in his boring, logical goals.`,
    },
    the_unchained: {
        archie: `Archie is a powerful symbol of liberation. His destruction of Iron Fists operations and his defiance of the Regal Empire make him a folk hero to many rebels. His actions, while not always intentional, directly benefit their cause, giving him high notoriety and a positive reputation.`,
        markop: `His role in freeing the toad slaves and his opposition to tyranny, despite his past, have earned him respect. The Ideologues see him as a powerful convert to their cause, a symbol that even agents of order can be broken and remade in the fight for freedom.`,
        humpik: `Humpik's loyalty is to a monarch, which is an ideology the Unchained oppose. He is viewed with suspicion as an agent of a different brand of tyranny, not a true ally in the cause of freedom for all.`,
        bowser: `The Unchained see Bowser as a hypocrite. He fights the Empire but seeks to build his own. He is a tyrant who uses the language of rebellion for his own selfish gain, and they do not trust him.`,
    },
    silver_flame: {
        archie: `The Order sees Archie as a heretic of the highest order. He consorts with monsters, uses profane magic, and is an agent of chaos. The Purifier faction considers him a primary target for cleansing, and his name is well-known to their inquisitors.`,
        markop: `Markop is a source of great debate and sorrow. The Templars believe his soul can still be redeemed and watch him for signs of repentance. The Purifiers, however, see him as a fallen paladin, the worst kind of traitor, who must be put down. His notoriety is high within the Order.`,
        humpik: `Seen as the monstrous muscle for a villainous warlord, Humpik is just another creature of darkness that needs to be purged from the world in the eyes of the Silver Flame.`,
        bowser: `Bowser is a monster leading an army of monsters. To the Silver Flame, he is a clear and obvious evil, a blight upon the world that must be eradicated. There is no nuance here; he is a primary enemy.`,
    },
    oathbound_judges: {
        archie: `Archie's criminal record is extensive and well-documented. The Truthbearer faction sees him as a career lawbreaker who is long overdue for judgment. The Arbiters of Intent, however, note that his crimes often lead to a greater good, making his case a fascinating legal and ethical paradox.`,
        markop: `As a former paladin, Markop is held to a higher standard. His willing association with criminals is a grave offense in the eyes of the Judges. They see him as an officer of the law who has betrayed his oath, a crime they take very seriously.`,
        humpik: `Humpik is judged by the actions of his superior. As he knowingly and willingly aids a lawless warlord in his campaigns, he is considered a co-conspirator in all of Bowser's crimes.`,
        bowser: `The Judges view Bowser as the leader of an illegitimate state and a rogue entity operating outside of cosmic law. His entire campaign is a violation of established treaties and natural order, and they are building a case against him.`,
    },
    da_krumperz: {
        archie: `Archie is great! He makes big, loud booms! Da Weirdboyz are fascinated by the 'good noises' in his head, and the Big Bosses respect anyone who can cause so much destruction. He's always welcome in a WAAAGH!`,
        markop: `A bit stuffy for their tastes, but he can fight, and that's all that matters. They see him as a 'proper tough git' when he gets going, and they respect his combat prowess.`,
        humpik: `Humpik is seen as a proper Ork in spirit: big, strong, and loyal to his boss. They view him as a worthy rival and a great example of a 'good fighter'.`,
        bowser: `Bowser is a proper Warboss! He leads a big army, he's always looking for a fight, and he's not afraid to get his hands dirty. Da Krumperz view him with immense respect and would gladly join his WAAAGH!`,
    },
    ratchet_raiders: {
        archie: `Archie is their patron saint. He blows up the newest, fanciest Imperial technology, leaving a trail of high-quality, valuable scrap for them to salvage. The Boomers love his style, and the Scrap Barons love the profits he generates. He is a celebrated hero.`,
        markop: `The Raiders think Markop is a killjoy. He's the type to lecture them about safety regulations and proper maintenance. They avoid him, as his orderly nature clashes with their love of chaotic engineering.`,
        humpik: `Humpik's association with Bowser's war machines makes him interesting. They see him as a potential client or a source of unique scrap from the Koopa Troop's strange contraptions.`,
        bowser: `The Raiders are fascinated by the Koopa Troop's war machines. They see Bowser as a brilliant, if eccentric, Mekaniak who has created a unique brand of clunky but effective technology. They respect his ingenuity.`,
    },
    koopa_troop: {
        archie: `A useful but dangerous tool. Bowser's Elite and the Kamek Cabal are wary of his instability, fearing he could turn on them. The common soldiers, however, think his explosions are cool and are happy to have him on their side.`,
        markop: `Markop's position is precarious. He is not one of them, and his history as a paladin makes the Kamek Cabal deeply suspicious. He is tolerated only because the King trusts him, but he is watched constantly.`,
        humpik: `Humpik is the embodiment of loyalty and strength, revered by the entire Troop. He is seen as the King's right hand and a model soldier that all other troop members should aspire to be. His reputation is spotless.`,
        bowser: `He is the King. His reputation is absolute. The Troop's loyalty is unwavering, and his word is law. Every soldier would follow him to the end.`,
    },
    rebel_clans: {
        archie: `To the New Wave Rebels, Archie is a hero whose attacks on the Empire are legendary. The traditional Old Clans, however, are suspicious of his extreme methods and his association with a monarch like Bowser, making him a divisive figure.`,
        markop: `Markop's defiance of his Imperial past resonates with the rebels. They see him as someone who has seen the truth of Imperial oppression and now fights against it, making him a powerful symbol for their cause.`,
        humpik: `The clans see Humpik as an agent of a foreign monarch. They are fighting to be free of kings and emperors, so they view him and his master with deep suspicion, as potential future oppressors.`,
        bowser: `Bowser's offer of alliance is seen as a deal with a devil. While the New Wave is desperate enough to consider it, the Old Clans see him as just another tyrant trying to replace the Emperor. They do not trust him or his ambitions.`,
    },
    crimson_fleet: {
        archie: `Archie has the spirit of a true pirate: he's chaotic, defies authority, and leaves destruction in his wake. The Free Captains love his style, and the Pirate Lords see him as someone with a strong, if unpredictable, 'reputation'.`,
        markop: `The Fleet is deeply suspicious of Markop. A man of the law, even a fallen one, is not to be trusted on a pirate vessel. They see him as a liability, likely to turn on them the moment it suits his moral code.`,
        humpik: `The pirates respect Humpik as a loyal first mate to a powerful captain (Bowser). He is seen as strong, reliable muscle, an essential part of any good crew.`,
        bowser: `The Pirate Lords see Bowser as a kindred spirit: a king of his own domain who answers to no one. They respect his power, his fleet, and his open defiance of the Empire, viewing him as a powerful potential ally on the high seas.`,
    },
    wario_land: {
        archie: `Archie is bad for business... unless he's breaking someone else's business, then he's great! He's a chaotic investment. Lario avoids him, but Wario sees potential for profit in his wake.`,
        markop: `A potential mark. His 'honor' means he's probably carrying a fat coin purse he's not willing to defend with dirty tricks. An easy target if he's ever alone.`,
        humpik: `Big, dumb muscle. Probably costs a fortune in food. Not a cost-effective asset.`,
        bowser: `A competitor. He wants to conquer, we want to own. His methods are too destructive, which is bad for property values. Wario respects his ambition but dislikes his methods.`,
    },
    mushroom_regency: {
        archie: `A dangerous anarchist. His actions, along with Bowser's, contributed to the destabilization that led to the death of the Princess. He is a villain, plain and simple.`,
        markop: `A tragic figure. While his association with Bowser is a grave concern, his mentorship of Dan the Toad is the only reason he isn't considered an enemy of the state. He is watched with cautious hope.`,
        humpik: `A high-ranking commander in the army of our greatest enemy. He is directly responsible for past invasions and is considered a primary military threat.`,
        bowser: `The monster responsible for everything. His endless war led to the death of our Princess and the fracturing of our kingdom. There is no name more hated in the halls of the Regency.`,
    },
    peach_loyalists: {
        archie: `An accomplice to Bowser, the monster who created the chaos that killed our Princess. He is an enemy to be crushed.`,
        markop: `He consorts with our mortal enemy, Bowser. Any good he does for Dan the Toad is negated by this unforgivable alliance. He is a traitor to the cause of justice.`,
        humpik: `One of Bowser's beasts. He is a butcher and a villain, and will be shown no mercy when we restore the true Queen.`,
        bowser: `The ultimate evil. He is the reason the Princess is gone. The Regency is too weak to bring him to justice, but we are not. He will pay for his crimes in blood.`,
    },
    iron_fists: {
        archie: `Archie is a dead man walking. He directly attacked their operations, costing them a fortune and making them look weak. A substantial bounty is on his head, and his notoriety is infamous. The only positive view comes from Upstarts who see the chaos he caused as an opportunity.`,
        markop: `As Archie's accomplice in the raid, Markop shares the blame. The Iron Fists have marked him for death, and his reputation is that of a meddling do-gooder who stuck his nose where it didn't belong. Their attempt to use a goblin imposter against him suggests they see him as a notable obstacle.`,
        humpik: `The Fists see Humpik as just more muscle allied with their enemies. They don't have a personal grudge, but he stands with those who cost them money, so he is a target by association.`,
        bowser: `The Iron Fists see Bowser as a potential business partner or a major threat, depending on the day. They respect his power but would not hesitate to move against him if he interfered in their territory.`,
    },
    moonfang_pack: {
        archie: `The werewolves are ambivalent. His chaotic nature is unsettling, but he fights the vampires of the Onyx Hand, their sworn enemies. He is a weird, unpredictable stray that they tolerate as long as he stays focused on their foes.`,
        markop: `The Pack respects Markop's honorable nature and his prowess as a warrior. His opposition to the Onyx Hand makes him a welcome ally in their shadow war. He is seen as a trustworthy fighter.`,
        humpik: `A strong fighter is always respected. The Alphas see Humpik as a formidable brawler and a valuable asset in any large-scale fight. His strength is his reputation.`,
        bowser: `Bowser is a powerful Alpha leading his own pack. The Moonfang Alphas respect his strength and territorial ambition. As he also opposes the Onyx Hand, he is viewed as a powerful and respectable ally in their struggle.`,
    },
    liberated_toads: {
        archie: `The Toads see Archie as a terrifying but essential liberator. Dan and the more optimistic toads focus on the freedom he provided, while the more cynical ones like Toad Lee and Bones see him as a dangerous, unpredictable tool that could turn on them at any moment.`,
        markop: `Markop is universally hailed as a hero and leader. Dan sees him as a mentor, Toad Lee sees him as a commander, and the others see him as their primary protector. His reputation among them is nearly spotless, as he represents the hope and order they now cling to.`,
        humpik: `Most toads view Humpik as a straightforward, powerful ally. They appreciate his strength in battle but are somewhat intimidated by his size and volume. They see him as a loyal soldier, which they can understand and respect.`,
        bowser: `The toads are deeply suspicious of Bowser. Having just escaped one form of tyranny, they are wary of another king, especially one with a reputation for conquest. Roger sees the practical value in the alliance, but most, like Dan, view him as a potential future enemy.`,
    }
