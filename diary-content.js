        entry: `The air in the castle feels heavy. Chancellor Toadsworth worries about Bowser's latest troop movements, but it's more than that. There's a... dissonant note in the court's symphony. A new advisor, sent by a minor noble house, speaks with such sweetness, but his eyes are cold. He calls himself a "purveyor of fine beans." I do not trust him.`

    {
        date: "October 16, Year 42",
        entry: `I've dismissed the Beanish advisor, but the strange feeling lingers. He left a 'gift'â€”a peculiar helmet. It hums with a strange energy. I've had Kamek's apprentices look at it, but even they are baffled. I've ordered it locked away in the lower vaults. Still, I can't shake the feeling of being watched.`

        date: "October 19, Year 42",
        entry: `My research into the kingdom's founding has unearthed legends of three artifacts of immense power. The Star of Radiance is said to hold the very light of the cosmos. The stories say it can bring about an age of unparalleled peace... or absolute tyranny. I feel a desperate need to find it, as if it's the only key to breaking this endless cycle with Bowser.`

    {
        date: "October 22, Year 42",
        entry: `It's not Bowser. The threat is already inside. I hear... chortles in the halls at night. A green madness is seeping through the stones of this castle. The guards are on edge. I write this in haste. If something happens to me, do not look to the Koopa King. Look for the fury in the shadows.`
