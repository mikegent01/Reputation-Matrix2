    'archie': {
        'markop': { type: 'ally', text: "Archie on Markop: A stuffy, self-righteous shield. But he's a reliable shield, and sometimes, you need one of those. He's taking forever with the kid. If you want something done, you have to nudge the 'honorable' ones in the right direction." },
        'humpik': { type: 'ally', text: "Archie on Humpik: Simple. Predictable. Useful for hitting things. Points in the right direction and he goes." },
        'bowser': { type: 'ally', text: "Archie on Bowser: He can yell all he wants. I'm the one who gets things done, even if it's messy. He's just another would-be king, but his desire to smash the Empire is useful. A temporary, powerful convenience." },
        'dan': { type: 'ally', text: "Archie on Dan: The kid's got guts, I'll give him that. But all that 'hope' stuff is gonna get him killed. Or worse, make him boring. He's Markop's project, but a little push in a more... *interesting* direction couldn't hurt. For his own good, of course." },
        'toad_lee': { type: 'ally', text: "Archie on Toad Lee: Big axe, bigger frown. He's useful for hitting things, but don't expect any sparkling conversation." },
        'eager': { type: 'ally', text: "Archie on Eager: Skittish little guy. All that jumping around with his whip is... amusing. For a minute." },
        'roger': { type: 'ally', text: "Archie on Roger: This one's got the right idea. A gun solves a lot of problems talk can't. Smart." },
        'ryan': { type: 'ally', text: "Archie on Ryan: He's watching the kid with the staff. Good. Competition makes things interesting. Maybe he'll learn something useful, like how to make a proper explosion." },
        'bones': { type: 'ally', text: "Archie on Bones: He gets it. The world's a trash fire. He's just trying to stay warm. Respectable." },
        'wallys_toad': { type: 'ally', text: "Archie on Wally's Toad: A spy! In our little band of misfits! WAH-nderful! Waluigi's got style. Pity he got caught." },
        'emperor_elagabalus': { type: 'enemy', text: "Archie on Elagabalus: The ultimate symbol of the oppressive, boring order I despise. His Empire needs to be torn down, brick by brick." },
        'general_marcus_ironhand': { type: 'enemy', text: "Archie on Ironhand: Discipline is just another word for boring. He wouldn't know a good opportunity if it blew up in his face. I should arrange that." },
        'lord_crimson': { type: 'ally', text: "Archie on Lord Crimson: He understands the value of chaos. A dangerous, but amusing, player in the game." },
        'archmage_theron': { type: 'enemy', text: "Archie on Theron: All his rules and regulations for magic are a cage. Cages are meant to be broken." },
        'chief_thornpaw': { type: 'enemy', text: "Archie on Thornpaw: He talks to trees. Whatever. As long as he stays out of my way." },
        'high_inquisitor_vale': { type: 'enemy', text: "Archie on Vale: Another fanatic in a shiny suit who wants to burn anything fun. Get in line." },
        'captain_syrup': { type: 'enemy', text: "Archie on Captain Syrup: She's got style, I'll give her that. But she's just as greedy as the rest. Got in my way." },
        'boss_knuckles': { type: 'enemy', text: "Archie on Knuckles: Thinks he's tough. He's just another obstacle. One that's fun to blow up." },
        'alpha_bloodmaw': { type: 'ally', text: "Archie on Bloodmaw: Angry, hairy, and hates vampires. What's not to like?" },
        'chancellor_toadsworth': { type: 'enemy', text: "Archie on Toadsworth: Just another bureaucrat trying to hold onto the scraps of a broken system. Pathetic." },
        'captain_toadette': { type: 'enemy', text: "Archie on Toadette: A fanatic. Blind loyalty is even more boring than regular loyalty. At least she's angry." },
        'earl_grey': { type: 'enemy', text: "Archie on Earl Grey: Big guy with an axe. Almost as boring as Humpik, but on the wrong side." },
        'lario': { type: 'ally', text: "Archie on Lario: A greasy little goblin who'd sell his own brother for a gold coin. Which he basically is. Useful for fixing things and taking the fall." },
        'internet_federation': { type: 'enemy', text: "Archie on The Internet Federation: More boring 'order' in a shiny new package. All their rules and protocols are just begging to be broken. A new playground!" },
        'hacktivist_collectives': { type: 'ally', text: "Archie on The Hacktivist Collectives: Finally, some people who get it! Information freedom, chaos, disrupting the system... they're artists! My kind of people." },
        'bryan': { type: 'enemy', text: "Archie on Bryan: Another ghost from the past. He thinks I left him for dead? Please. In my line of work, people get left. He should have been faster. Now he's just another problem to solve." }
    },
    'markop': {
        'archie': { type: 'ally', text: "Markop on Archie: A force of pure chaos. His methods are reprehensible, but his actions sometimes lead to a greater good. A soul to be guided, if possible. His recent 'interest' in Dan's training is... concerning. I must ensure the boy's path remains his own." },
        'humpik': { type: 'ally', text: "Markop on Humpik: His loyalty is commendable, though his ally is questionable. A strong arm in a just fight." },
        'bowser': { type: 'enemy', text: "Markop on Bowser: A tyrant and a warlord. His goals are antithetical to justice and order. An alliance of desperation, not trust." },
        'dan': { type: 'ally', text: "Markop on Dan: A student with a purer heart than I ever had. He is a reflection of the good we fight for, and I must not fail him." },
        'toad_lee': { type: 'ally', text: "Markop on Toad Lee: A steadfast warrior. His dedication to protecting the others is admirable. He is the rock upon which their safety is built." },
        'eager': { type: 'ally', text: "Markop on Eager: His speed is an asset, but he must learn to master his fear. Courage is not the absence of fear, but acting in spite of it." },
        'roger': { type: 'ally', text: "Markop on Roger: His methods are... direct. A firearm is not an honorable weapon, but in these times, survival often outweighs tradition. He is a capable protector." },
        'ryan': { type: 'ally', text: "Markop on Ryan: He has a gift. I hope he learns to wield it with wisdom and restraint, for magic is a powerful but dangerous tool." },
        'bones': { type: 'ally', text: "Markop on Bones: He has endured much. His cynicism is a scar, a shield against a world that has been cruel. But there is strength in him yet." },
        'wallys_toad': { type: 'enemy', text: "Markop on Wally's Toad: Treachery is a poison that can destroy us from within. He must answer for his betrayal, but justice, not vengeance, must guide our hand." },
        'emperor_elagabalus': { type: 'enemy', text: "Markop on Elagabalus: His Imperial 'peace' is a gilded cage built on the backs of the oppressed. True order comes from justice, not force." },
        'general_marcus_ironhand': { type: 'enemy', text: "Markop on Ironhand: A man who confuses discipline with cruelty. His Legion brings order, but it is the order of the executioner's block." },
        'lord_crimson': { type: 'enemy', text: "Markop on Lord Crimson: An ancient evil that plays with mortals as if they were pawns. He represents a corruption that must be cleansed." },
        'archmage_theron': { type: 'enemy', text: "Markop on Theron: He seeks to cage a storm. Magic is a part of the world, and his fear of its misuse only creates the very monsters he dreads." },
        'chief_thornpaw': { type: 'ally', text: "Markop on Thornpaw: A wise and honorable leader. He understands the balance of the world in a way the 'civilized' rulers do not." },
        'high_inquisitor_vale': { type: 'enemy', text: "Markop on Vale: He has twisted the faith I once held into a weapon of blind hatred. He is a cautionary tale, a mirror of what I could have become." },
        'captain_syrup': { type: 'enemy', text: "Markop on Syrup: A pirate who lives by no code but her own greed. She is a symptom of the lawlessness we must fight." },
        'chancellor_toadsworth': { type: 'ally', text: "Markop on Toadsworth: A good man trying to hold his world together in a time of crisis. He has my sympathies, and my aid if he should ask it." },
        'captain_toadette': { type: 'enemy', text: "Markop on Toadette: Her loyalty is admirable, but it has become a blinding fanaticism. She cannot see that her actions are creating more chaos, not less." },
        'lario': { type: 'ally', text: "Markop on Lario: He was in danger. I acted as my oath would compel me to. His life has value, no matter his past deeds." }
    },
    'humpik': {
        'bowser': { type: 'ally', text: "Humpik on Bowser: King Bowser is my friend. We fight together now. It is good." },
        'archie': { type: 'ally', text: "Humpik on Archie: The little guy is crazy! But he makes big explosions! Good to have in a scrap." },
        'markop': { type: 'ally', text: "Humpik on Markop: The horse-man is too serious. But he fights good. I respect that. He and the little guy argue a lot now. About the other little guy. Weird." },
        'waluigi': { type: 'ally', text: "Humpik on Waluigi: The skinny purple man... he grew wings! And saved me! He is strange, but he is a friend. A good friend. I owe him." },
        'iron_thorn': { type: 'enemy', text: "Humpik on Iron Thorn: Metal man hurt my friend! I hit him with my axe! If I see him again, I will hit him harder!" },

        'eager': { type: 'ally', text: "Humpik on Eager: He's fast! Hard to hit! Good!" },
        'roger': { type: 'ally', text: "Humpik on Roger: He has a boom-stick! Loud! Good for fighting!" },
        'ryan': { type: 'ally', text: "Humpik on Ryan: He does the sparkly stuff. Like Kamek. Weird, but can be strong." },
        'bones': { type: 'ally', text: "Humpik on Bones: He looks like he's been in a lot of fights. He's a tough little guy." },
        'wallys_toad': { type: 'enemy', text: "Humpik on Wally's Toad: Sneaky little toad! He was a spy! Spies are not strong! They get smashed!" },
        'black_t': { type: 'neutral', text: "Humpik on Black T: Small toad in black. Talked about toad selling. He was hiding. Strange."}
    },
    'bowser': {
        'archie': { type: 'ally', text: "Bowser on Archie: He's useful, but his chaos nearly cost us everything! I thought he had this under control. He's on thin ice." },
        'markop': { type: 'ally', text: "Bowser on Markop: The horse-man has honor, which is a weakness. But he's a strong fighter. He keeps the little guys in line, so he's useful for now." },
        'humpik': { type: 'ally', text: "Bowser on Humpik: My most loyal soldier! He is the strength of the Koopa Troop made manifest! GWAHAHAHA!" },
        'waluigi': { type: 'neutral', text: "Bowser on Waluigi: The purple string bean? He's a schemer. Useful for now, but not to be trusted. He got Humpik out, so... credit where it's due." }
    },
    'waluigi': {
        'archie': { type: 'ally', text: "Waluigi on Archie: WAH! A true artist of chaos! He understands the beauty of a well-placed explosion! A worthy apprentice!" },
        'markop': { type: 'neutral', text: "Waluigi on Markop: So boring! All 'honor' and 'justice'. He's the straight man in my brilliant comedy!" },
        'humpik': { type: 'ally', text: "Waluigi on Humpik: The big guy needed a hand! An old sinner's hand! It was a magnificent exit, WAH-HA-HA! He owes me one." },
        'bowser': { type: 'neutral', text: "Waluigi on Bowser: Another big, angry brute who wants to rule everything. So unoriginal! But his army is a useful distraction." },
        'lario': { type: 'enemy', text: "Waluigi on Lario: My brilliant plan to save Humpik didn't have room for... extra baggage. He should be grateful I didn't drop him on purpose! WAH!" }

    'dan': {
        'archie': { type: 'ally', text: "Dan on Archie: He's... a lot. He freed us, and I can't forget that. But his methods are terrifying. He's like a wildfire you hope is pointed at the enemy." },
