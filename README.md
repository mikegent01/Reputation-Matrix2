## Project Philosophy

To ensure readability and maintainability, this project follows a modular structure. JavaScript files, particularly those containing significant logic or UI rendering code, are kept concise. The general guideline is to keep files under **500-600 lines**. This approach makes it easier for developers to quickly understand the purpose of a file and navigate the codebase effectively.
